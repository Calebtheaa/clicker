(contains notes if you get stuck)


if you get a file not found error, edit the code to use your directory to save.txt in lines 11, 111, and 145.
  example:
  "with open(r'C:\Users\birtw\Downloads\clicker-main\clicker-main\save.txt', 'w') as file:" to with open(r'your directory here', 'w') as file:
if you lose your save, make a new text document named "save" and copy everything inbetween the lines into it, include the blank spaces too. (resets everything)
